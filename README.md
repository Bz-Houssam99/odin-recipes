The project's goal is to build a basic recipes website with only some basic html knowledge. 
And also i have certain skills ( hard and soft) that i'm hoping to demonstrate by the end of the project , which are the following :

  _  Better git commits' writing 
  _  good working real application of the html concepts i learned 
  _  better researching skills 
  _  became more used to using some of git's most important commands and subcommands 
  _  better thinker/ problem solver.

  nb: i might add more skills later!
